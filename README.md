# Runner 51

Runner 51 is one of the first project I had completed in the Unity engine and was done in a few days with a small team.

The game is a simple sidescrolling platformer featuring three differently styled levels each with their own hand drawn parallaxing backgrounds.

The game is lacking a lot of content however due to the time span it was created in.

A video demonstation of the game can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nzGVOz-jzQ&ab_channel=Alex
